			<p>In recent decades, education has increasingly moved online. It's now possible to attain undergraduate and even graduate degrees from reputable colleges and universities, and in a wide range of subjects, without ever leaving your home. Even traditional college courses offered on campus are now integrating more online components than ever. Online education has proven that it is here to stay and the rapid growth of the thriving telemedicine industry has shown that healthcare is the next new frontier. If current trends are any indication, online medical services will only grow. Already, the competition among online medical providers is fierce. New startups and established traditional practices alike are working toward building an Internet presence to claim their share of an increasingly discerning patient population.</p><br>
